<para id="fs-id2325345">The skeletal muscles are divided into <term id="term-00001">axial</term> (muscles of the trunk and head) and <term id="term-00002">appendicular</term> (muscles of the arms and legs) categories. This system reflects the bones of the skeleton system, which are also arranged in this manner. The axial muscles are grouped based on location, function, or both. Some of the axial muscles may seem to blur the boundaries because they cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The first grouping of the axial muscles you will review includes the muscles of the head and neck, then you will review the muscles of the vertebral column, and finally you will review the oblique and rectus muscles.</para>

<title>Muscles That Create Facial Expression</title>
<para id="fs-id2928107">The origins of the muscles of facial expression are on the surface of the skull (remember, the origin of a muscle does not move). The insertions of these muscles have fibers intertwined with connective tissue and the dermis of the skin. Because the muscles insert in the skin rather than on bone, when they contract, the skin moves to create facial expression (<link target-id="fig-ch11_03_01" document=""/>).</para>

The <term id="term-00005">occipitofrontalis</term> muscle moves up the scalp and eyebrows. The muscle has a frontal belly and an occipital (near the occipital bone on the posterior part of the skull) belly. In other words, there is a muscle on the forehead (<term id="term-00006">frontalis</term>) and one on the back of the head (<term id="term-00007">occipitalis</term>), but there is no muscle across the top of the head. Instead, the two bellies are connected by a broad tendon called the <term id="term-00008">epicranial aponeurosis</term>, or galea aponeurosis (galea = “helmet”). The physicians originally studying human anatomy thought the skull looked like a helmet.</para><para id="fs-id2500664">A large portion of the face is composed of the <term id="term-00009">buccinator</term> muscle, which compresses the cheek.

There are several small facial muscles, one of which is the <term id="term-00010">corrugator supercilii</term>, which is the prime mover of the eyebrows. Place your finger on your eyebrows at the point of the bridge of the nose. Raise your eyebrows as if you were surprised and lower your eyebrows as if you were frowning.

<media id="fs-id2319967" alt="This table describes the muscles used in facial expressions. To raise the eyebrows, as when showing surprise, the skin of the scalp moves in an anterior direction. The prime mover is the occipitofrontalis frontal belly, which originates from the epicraneal aponeurosis and inserts underneath the skin of the forehead. To tense and retract the scalp, the skin of the scalp moves in the posterior direction. The prime mover is the occipitofrontalis occipital belly, which originates from the occipital bone and the mastoid process of the temporal bone and inserts into the epicraneal aponeurosis. To lower the eyebrows, as when scowling or frowning, the skin underneath the eyebrows moves in an inferior direction. The prime mover is the corrugator supercilii, which originates from the frontal bone and inserts into the skin underneath the eyebrow. To flare the nostrils, the nasal cartilage is compressed in an inferior and posterior direction. The prime mover is the nasalis, which originates from the maxilla and inserts into the nasal bone. Raising the upper lip involves elevating the upper lip tissue. The prime mover is the levator labii superioris, which originates from the maxilla and inserts underneath the skin at the corners of the mouth and also into the orbicularis oris. Lowering the lower lip involves depressing the lip and also moving it laterally. The prime mover is the depressor angulus oris, which originates from the mandible and inserts underneath the skin of the lower lip. Opening the mouth and sliding the lower jaw left and right involves depressing the lower jaw and also moving it laterally. The prime mover is thecdepressor angulus oris, which originates from the mandible and inserts underneath the skin at the corners of the mouth. Smiling involves elevating the corners of the mouth and also moving them in a lateral direction. The prime mover is the zygomaticus major, which originates from the zygomatic bone and inserts underneath the skin at the corners of the mouth in the dimple area, and also into the orbicularis oris. Shaping of the lips as during speech involves moving the lips in multiple directions. The prime mover is the orbicularis oris which originates from the tissue surrounding the lips and inserts underneath the skin at the corners of the mouth. Lateral movement of the cheeks such as when sucking on a straw or to compress air in the mouth while blowing involves moving the cheeks in a lateral direction. The prime mover is the buccinator, which originates from the maxilla, the mandible, and the sphenoid bone via the pterygomandibular raphae, and inserts into the orbicularis oris. Pursing of the lips by straightening them laterally involves moving the corners of the mouth in a lateral direction. The prime mover is the risorius, which originates from the fascia of the parotid salivary gland and inserts underneath the skin at the corners of the mouth. Protrusion of the lower lip, as when making a pouting expression, involves protracting the lower lip and the skin of the chin. The prime mover is the mentalis, which originates from the mandible and inserts underneath the skin of the chin.">

<title>Anesthesia and the Tongue Muscles</title>
<para id="fs-id2488758">
Before surgery, a patient must be made ready for general anesthesia. The normal homeostatic controls of the body are put “on hold” so that the patient can be prepped for surgery. Control of respiration must be switched from the patient’s homeostatic control to the control of the anesthesiologist. The drugs used for anesthesia relax a majority of the body’s muscles.</para>
<para id="fs-id2419404">Among the muscles affected during general anesthesia are those that are necessary for breathing and moving the tongue. Under anesthesia, the tongue can relax and partially or fully block the airway, and the muscles of respiration may not move the diaphragm or chest wall. To avoid possible complications, the safest procedure to use on a patient is called endotracheal intubation. Placing a tube into the trachea allows the doctors to maintain a patient’s (open) airway to the lungs and seal the airway off from the oropharynx. Post-surgery, the anesthesiologist gradually changes the mixture of the gases that keep the patient unconscious, and when the muscles of respiration begin to function, the tube is removed. It still takes about 30 minutes for a patient to wake up, and for breathing muscles to regain control of respiration. After surgery, most people have a sore or scratchy throat for a few days.</para>

<caption>The large, complex muscles of the neck and back move the head, shoulders, and vertebral column.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id2586421">The <term id="term-00036">erector spinae group</term> forms the majority of the muscle mass of the back and it is the primary extensor of the vertebral column. It controls flexion, lateral flexion, and rotation of the vertebral column, and maintains the lumbar curve. The erector spinae comprises the iliocostalis (laterally placed) group, the longissimus (intermediately placed) group, and the spinalis (medially placed) group.</para>
<para id="fs-id2419122">The <term id="term-00037">iliocostalis group</term> includes the <term id="term-00038">iliocostalis cervicis</term>, associated with the cervical region; the <term id="term-00039">iliocostalis thoracis</term>, associated with the thoracic region; and the <term id="term-00040">iliocostalis lumborum</term>, associated with the lumbar region. The three muscles of the <term id="term-00041">longissimus group</term> are the <term id="term-00042">longissimus capitis</term>, associated with the head region; the <term id="term-00043">longissimus cervicis</term>, associated with the cervical region; and the <term id="term-00044">longissimus thoracis</term>, associated with the thoracic region. The third group, the <term id="term-00045">spinalis group</term>, comprises the <term id="term-00046">spinalis capitis</term> (head region), the <term id="term-00047">spinalis cervicis</term> (cervical region), and the <term id="term-00048">spinalis thoracis</term> (thoracic region).</para>
<para id="fs-id2808964">The <term id="term-00049">transversospinales</term> muscles run from the transverse processes to the spinous processes of the vertebrae. Similar to the erector spinae muscles, the semispinalis muscles in this group are named for the areas of the body with which they are associated. The semispinalis muscles include the <term id="term-00050">semispinalis capitis</term>, the <term id="term-00051">semispinalis cervicis</term>, and the <term id="term-00052">semispinalis thoracis</term>. The <term id="term-00053">multifidus</term> muscle of the lumbar region helps extend and laterally flex the vertebral column.</para>
<para id="fs-id2080091">Important in the stabilization of the vertebral column is the <term id="term-00054">segmental muscle group</term>, which includes the interspinales and intertransversarii muscles. These muscles bring together the spinous and transverse processes of each consecutive vertebra. Finally, the <term id="term-00055">scalene muscles</term> work together to flex, laterally flex, and rotate the head. They also contribute to deep inhalation. The scalene muscles include the <term id="term-00056">anterior scalene</term> muscle (anterior to the middle scalene), the <term id="term-00057">middle scalene</term> muscle (the longest, intermediate between the anterior and posterior scalenes), and the <term id="term-00058">posterior scalene</term> muscle (the smallest, posterior to the middle scalene).</para>

<title>Chapter Review</title>
<para id="fs-id2253683">Muscles are either axial muscles or appendicular. The axial muscles are grouped based on location, function, or both. Some axial muscles cross over to the appendicular skeleton. The muscles of the head and neck are all axial. The muscles in the face create facial expression by inserting into the skin rather than onto bone. Muscles that move the eyeballs are extrinsic, meaning they originate outside of the eye and insert onto it. Tongue muscles are both extrinsic and intrinsic. The genioglossus depresses the tongue and moves it anteriorly; the styloglossus lifts the tongue and retracts it; the palatoglossus elevates the back of the tongue; and the hyoglossus depresses and flattens it. The muscles of the anterior neck facilitate swallowing and speech, stabilize the hyoid bone and position the larynx. The muscles of the neck stabilize and move the head. The sternocleidomastoid divides the neck into anterior and posterior triangles.</para>
<para id="fs-id1953872">The muscles of the back and neck that move the vertebral column are complex, overlapping, and can be divided into five groups. The splenius group includes the splenius capitis and the splenius cervicis. The erector spinae has three subgroups. The iliocostalis group includes the iliocostalis cervicis, the iliocostalis thoracis, and the iliocostalis lumborum. The longissimus group includes the longissimus capitis, the longissimus cervicis, and the longissimus thoracis. The spinalis group includes the spinalis capitis, the spinalis cervicis, and the spinalis thoracis. The transversospinales include the semispinalis capitis, semispinalis cervicis, semispinalis thoracis, multifidus, and rotatores. The segmental muscles include the interspinales and intertransversarii. Finally, the scalenes include the anterior scalene, middle scalene, and posterior scalene.</para>
