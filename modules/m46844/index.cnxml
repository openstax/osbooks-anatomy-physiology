  <md:title>Preface </md:title>
  <md:abstract>Human Anatomy and Physiology is designed for the two-semester anatomy and physiology course taken by life science and allied health students.  The textbook follows the scope and sequence of most Human Anatomy and Physiology courses, and its coverage and organization were informed by hundreds of instructors who teach the course.  Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.
The artwork for this textbook is aimed focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.   Color is used sparingly, to emphasize the most important aspects of any given illustration.  Significant use of micrographs from the University of Michigan complement the illustrations, and provide the students with a meaningful alternate depiction of each concept.  Finally, enrichment elements provide relevance and deeper context for students, particularly in the areas of health, disease, and information relevant to their intended careers.</md:abstract>

The development choices for this textbook were guided by hundreds of faculty who are deeply involved in teaching this course, as well as instructional designers, academic success experts, and educational researchers who have supported A&amp;P educators and students. These choices led to innovations in art, terminology, career orientation, practical applications, and multimedia-based learning, all with a goal of increasing relevance to students. We strove to make the discipline engaging and relevant to students, so that they can draw from it a working knowledge that will enrich their future studies and support them in their careers.
</para><section id="eip-217"><title>Unit 1: Levels of Organization </title><para id="eip-719">Chapters 1–4 provide students with a basic understanding of human anatomy and physiology, including its language, the levels of organization, and the basics of chemistry and cell biology.  These chapters provide a foundation for the further study of the body.  They also focus particularly on how the body’s regions, important chemicals, and cells maintain homeostasis.<newline/>

  <title>Changes to the Second Edition</title>
  <para id="para-00001">
    The <emphasis effect="itlaics">Anatomy and Physiology 2e</emphasis> revision focuses on inclusive and equitable instruction, scientific accuracy, and enhanced instructor and student support. The improvements have been informed by extensive feedback from adopting faculty, curricular innovators, and equity experts.   
  </para>
  <list id="list-00001">
    <title>
      The revision includes the following core changes:
    </title>
    <item>In explanations of endocrine function, reproduction, development, inheritance, and related topics, the second edition is clearer and more accurate in differentiations related to sex, and eliminates incorrect equivalencies and generalizations regarding sex and gender. OpenStax thanks Sam Long and River Suh, founders of Gender-Inclusive Biology, for their extensive guidance and support.</item>
    <item>Many of the illustrations have been improved to be more representative of diverse populations. We have also added photos of many conditions, symptoms, and disorders that present differently depending on skin tone. (Note that many of the illustration changes were made prior to the second edition revision.)</item>
    <item>In discussions and illustrations of genetics and inheritance, the text is clearer in its terminology and explanations related to parenting and parental roles.</item>
    <item>Several research references, data, and terminology have been improved to improve representation and currency.</item>
  </list> 
  <para id="para-00002">
    These improvements are designed to create welcoming and inclusive learning experiences and promote scientifically accurate practices that students will encounter in their studies and careers. The additions and changes were made in a manner designed to enrich and support all users while maintaining the general approach of the text. Because OpenStax and our authors are aware of the difficulties posed by reorganization and renumbering, the extensive text and illustration changes have been implemented within the existing structure and organization of the book. A detailed transition guide will be available within the book’s Instructor Resources at OpenStax.org.

Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration. The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.
</para>

<para id="eip-id1167703115240">Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw students’ attention to the critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).
